# What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen both my technical and analytical skills as a SOC analyst in training.  

---

## Technical Learnings

- Learned how to ingest custom log datasets into Splunk  
- Understood SSH authentication log structure  
- Practiced writing effective SPL queries for detection  
- Learned how to identify brute-force patterns using data  
- Improved skills in filtering, sorting, and correlating events  
- Gained hands-on experience with MITRE ATT&CK mapping  

---

## Analytical Thinking

- Learned how to validate suspicious activity instead of assuming  
- Understood the importance of pattern analysis  
- Differentiated between normal behavior and malicious behavior  
- Learned how to confirm attacks using statistics  
- Improved incident investigation mindset  

---

## Defensive Security Mindset

- Understood real-world mitigation techniques  
- Learned about fail2ban and account lockout policies  
- Recognized the importance of MFA for SSH  
- Learned how proactive controls reduce attack surface  

---

## Professional Growth

- Improved technical documentation skills  
- Learned how to present findings clearly  
- Built confidence in real SOC-style analysis  
- Understood how detection engineering works  
- Developed structured investigation workflow  

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

This project taught me that effective threat detection is not about tools alone,  
but about **logic, validation, and analytical thinking**.

---

## Next Steps

- Add more detection scenarios in this repository (RDP, privilege escalation, etc.)  
- Improve correlation techniques  
- Explore automated response workflows  
- Continue building blue-team projects  

---

## Final Thought

This project enhanced my **hands-on experience** in security operations and detection engineering.
